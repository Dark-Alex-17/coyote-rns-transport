# coyote-rns-transport patch set

One section per published fork release of `coyote-rns-transport`. Each
section names the upstream `reticulum-rs-transport` release the fork build is
based on and lists every behavioural patch applied on top of it, with the
upstream site of the change and the fork commit that introduced it. The
package rename (`reticulum-rs-transport` to `coyote-rns-transport`) and the
matching edits to workspace manifests, scripts, CI workflows and docs are
not patches in this sense and are not listed here. The crate README
(`crates/libs/rns-transport/README.md`) carries the versioning policy, the
rebase recipe and a prose summary of the current patch list; this file is
the per-release ledger of the same patches, with commit hashes and file
sites, so a rebase can re-apply them one commit at a time.

## Unreleased

Fork commit `0197768d`: revise the smoke-script leg of the link-close patch.

- `tools/scripts/python-lxmd-rust-lxmd-smoke.sh`: no longer sets
  `NO_COLOR=1` for the Rust `lxmd` process. Both link-close waits now match
  the warn's own message text with the needle `close /[0-9a-f]{32}/`, so
  they no longer depend on how the log subscriber renders the target.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/README.md`: the patch-list paragraph is
  reworded to describe the message-text needle.
- `crates/apps/reticulumd/tests/fork_publish_contract.rs`: the test
  `link_close_needle_is_derivable_from_the_surviving_warn` pins the needle
  to the surviving `warn!` and to both smoke-script wait sites.

## 0.14.0 (upstream 0.14.0)

Fork commit `3f20c991`: drop the stdout print on link close.

- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/destination/link_parts/link_sections/next_watchdog_deadline.rs:143`
  (upstream site, inside `Link::finalize_local_close`): the line
  `println!("{}", link_close_line(&self.id));` is removed. The
  `log::warn!("close {}", self.id);` immediately after it survives and
  carries the same information through the logging facade.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/destination/link_parts/clamp_link_signalling.rs`:
  `link_close_line` gains `#[cfg(test)]`; its only remaining caller is the
  compatibility-marker unit test.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/no_stdout_prints_tests.rs` (new): source
  sweep test that walks `src/`, skips test files and inline test modules,
  and fails if any remaining line invokes `print!`, `println!`, `eprint!`,
  `eprintln!` or `dbg!`.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/lib.rs`: registers `no_stdout_prints_tests`
  under `#[cfg(test)]`.
- `tools/scripts/python-lxmd-rust-lxmd-smoke.sh`: sets `NO_COLOR=1` for the
  Rust `lxmd` process so the smoke script's "link close" wait can match the
  plain `warn!` rendering now that the stdout line is gone (superseded on
  `main` by `0197768d`; see Unreleased).
