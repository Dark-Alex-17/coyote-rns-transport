# coyote-rns-transport patch set

One section per published fork release of `coyote-rns-transport`. Each
section names the upstream `reticulum-rs-transport` release the fork build is
based on and lists every behavioural patch applied on top of it, with the
upstream site of the change and the fork commit that introduced it. The
package rename (`reticulum-rs-transport` to `coyote-rns-transport`) and the
matching edits to workspace manifests, scripts, CI workflows and docs are
not patches in this sense and are not listed here. The crate README
(`crates/libs/rns-transport/README.md`) carries the versioning policy, the
rebase recipe and a prose summary of the current patch list; this file is
the per-release ledger of the same patches, with commit hashes and file
sites, so a rebase can re-apply them one commit at a time.

## Unreleased

Fork commit `7f8b4c96`: send later Resource segments and Resource retries on
the link's bound interface.

- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/resource_wire.rs`
  (`handle_resource_proof`): the advertisement for the next segment, built
  by the ResourceManager when the previous segment's proof arrives, was
  dispatched with `handler.send_packet(response)`, which routes by the path
  table and never resolves a link id. It is now sent as
  `TxMessage { tx_type: TxMessageType::Direct(response_iface), .. }` where
  `response_iface` is `link.ingress_iface().unwrap_or(iface)`, captured
  before the link guard is dropped, matching the lower half of the same
  file and `RNS/Transport.py:1452-1454`.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/jobs.rs` (`resource-retry`
  worker, both loops): request retries read the link's `ingress_iface()`
  while the link guard is held; advertisement retries look the link up by
  the id `poll_outgoing` already returned through `link_ingress_iface`. Both
  loops resolve the link with `resource_wire::link_by_id` (shared with
  `link_for_resource_packet`), which tries the keyed lookups on `in_links`
  and `out_links` and then scans `out_links` by `link.id()` because that map
  is keyed by destination hash; a plain `get` on `out_links` never found an
  initiator-side link. Both dispatch through the new private
  `send_resource_retry`, which sends `Direct(iface)` and logs at debug when
  the dispatch trace reports no interface written. Path routing is only a
  fallback for a link without a bound interface; an advertisement whose link
  is already gone also ends up there.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/tests_parts/two_transport_loopback_resources.rs`
  (new): three broadcast-off loopback tests send a 300 KiB, a
  `MAX_EFFICIENT_SIZE + 64 KiB` and a `4 MiB + 1` response Resource and
  check the segment count, the payload and both terminal events. The two
  multi-segment cases time out on `2079a74e`; the single-segment case
  passes on both.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/tests_parts/two_transport_loopback_resources_directions.rs`
  (new): the initiator (out-link) side sending a split Resource, a split
  request Resource, and two split Resources back to back on one link.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/tests_parts/resource_retry_link_lookup.rs`
  (new): unit test for `link_ingress_iface` resolving an `out_links` entry
  by link id, an `in_links` entry, and an unknown id.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/tests_parts/two_transport_loopback_resources_retries.rs`
  (new): the listener's handler lock is held for five seconds so the
  connector's retry worker re-advertises (and, in the second test,
  re-requests); the retried packet must reach the listener's interface and
  the duplicate must not produce a second `Complete`. Both fail on
  `2079a74e`, each seeing a single advertisement or request.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/transport/tests.rs`: one `include!` line
  for each of the four test files above.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/CHANGELOG.md`: `### Fixed` bullet under
  `## Unreleased`.

Fork commit `0197768d`: revise the smoke-script leg of the link-close patch.
This is a mixed commit; only the files below are the patch leg, so re-apply
those hunks rather than cherry-picking the whole commit.

- `tools/scripts/python-lxmd-rust-lxmd-smoke.sh`: no longer sets
  `NO_COLOR=1` for the Rust `lxmd` process. Both link-close waits now match
  the warn's own message text with the needle `close /[0-9a-f]{32}/`, so
  they no longer depend on how the log subscriber renders the target.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/README.md`: the patch-list paragraph is
  reworded to describe the message-text needle.
- `crates/apps/reticulumd/tests/fork_publish_contract.rs`: the test
  `link_close_needle_is_derivable_from_the_surviving_warn` pins the needle
  to the surviving `warn!` and to both smoke-script wait sites.

## 0.14.0 (upstream 0.14.0)

Fork commit `3f20c991`: drop the stdout print on link close.

- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/destination/link_parts/link_sections/next_watchdog_deadline.rs:143`
  (upstream site, inside `Link::finalize_local_close`): the line
  `println!("{}", link_close_line(&self.id));` is removed. The
  `log::warn!("close {}", self.id);` immediately after it survives and
  carries the same information through the logging facade.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/destination/link_parts/clamp_link_signalling.rs`:
  `link_close_line` gains `#[cfg(test)]`; its only remaining caller is the
  compatibility-marker unit test.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/no_stdout_prints_tests.rs` (new): source
  sweep test that walks `src/`, skips test files and inline test modules,
  and fails if any remaining line invokes `print!`, `println!`, `eprint!`,
  `eprintln!` or `dbg!`.
- `crates/libs/rns-transport/src/lib.rs`: registers `no_stdout_prints_tests`
  under `#[cfg(test)]`.
- `tools/scripts/python-lxmd-rust-lxmd-smoke.sh`: sets `NO_COLOR=1` for the
  Rust `lxmd` process so the smoke script's "link close" wait can match the
  plain `warn!` rendering now that the stdout line is gone (superseded on
  `main` by `0197768d`; see Unreleased).
